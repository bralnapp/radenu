#### üë®‚Äçüíª The Core Architecture
- TheVault/Escrow√º
- The Sender
- The Settler
- The Receiver

The Vault: This is the key infrastructure of the network which holds funds and acts as an escrow on the platform. The Vault is built on smart contracts that execute when all conditions for the settlement are met.

The Sender: This is the user that initiates the remittance transaction (transfer) via a cryptocurrency payment and he/she is responsible for providing the details of the receiver in the form of a local bank account (fiat currency).

The Settler: This is the user that actually deposits the fiat currency to the receiver, the settler is usually resident in the receiver‚Äôs country OR can perform funds (fiat) transfer to the receiver‚Äôs local bank account.

The Receiver: This is the recipient of the fiat payment and they do not need to be on the platform, however, they can communicate with the Sender offline to acknowledge receipt of funds to their local bank account.
